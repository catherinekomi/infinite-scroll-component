# Infinite Scroll Component

## Overview

This project demonstrates a reusable Infinite Scroll component using React and JavaScript. The component dynamically fetches and displays data from an API as the user scrolls down the page. It leverages modern React features such as hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`) and the Intersection Observer API to implement the infinite scrolling functionality.

## Features

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Automatically loads more data as the user scrolls down the page.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from an API endpoint.
- **Reusable Component**: Designed to be easily reusable in different parts of an application or across different projects.
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficiently detects when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the list to load more data.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to various data sources and types of content.
